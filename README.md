<h1>Project Summary</h1>
<p>
This project explores the integration of machine learning with 
embedded systems to enhance understanding of both fields. The 
focus is on motion detection using neural networks deployed on 
the Arduino Nano BLE Sense 33, leveraging Edge Impulse's user
friendly software. This implementation not only demonstrates 
practical applications of machine learning but also highlights the 
process of deploying AI models on constrained hardware. The 
project encapsulates key learnings, including data collection, 
model training, and evaluation, providing a comprehensive 
overview of how machine learning can be effectively utilized in 
embedded systems.
